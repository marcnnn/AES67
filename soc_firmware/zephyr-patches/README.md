# Local Zephyr patches (alright to call it "AI slop")

Zephyr comes from our fork, https://github.com/malarisch/zephyr. Branch
`aes67` there is an upstream `main` snapshot with the patch series below
already applied (rebased and force-pushed on each upstream bump).
`soc_firmware/app/west-manifest/west.yml` follows that branch
(`revision: aes67`) — the fork exists only for this project, so its tip
is always the intended state. The tree is also the git submodule
`external/zephyr`, whose gitlink records which commit a given AES67
revision was built against (`git add external/zephyr` after `west update`
moved it; a stale gitlink is harmless, west checks out the tip anyway).
West still owns the workspace and fetches the imported modules. The
commits themselves live only on the fork — this file is the changelog
(`git log origin/main..aes67`).

Current base: upstream main 042104ba7e (2026-09-09).

Rebasing onto a newer upstream:

    # sync the fork's main with upstream on GitHub first ("Sync fork")
    cd external/zephyr
    git fetch origin main                      # origin = malarisch/zephyr
    git checkout aes67
    git rebase origin/main            # drop anything merged upstream meanwhile
    # build all targets + twister, then:
    git push --force-with-lease origin aes67
    # record the new tip: `git add external/zephyr` from the repo root,
    # then update "Current base" here

- 0001 spi_litex: local behaviour change (SPI_CS_ACTIVE_HIGH deasserts CS
  during transfer for SD-card init clocking; SPI_LOCK_ON ignored).
- 0002 net_if: use-after-free race in net_if_add_tx_timestamp (ref before
  fifo put) — candidate for upstream submission.
- 0003 ptp servo: step threshold 1 s → 5 ms via atomic ptp_clock_adjust()
  phase jump + anti-windup clamp on the PI integral. Without it the
  saturating wallclock rate correction (±524287 ppb) pins at the clamp
  and pi_drift winds up by millions of ppb after the boot-time step —
  candidate for upstream submission.
- 0004 ptp step: flush in-flight Delay_Reqs on a clock step. The epoch
  reset alone leaves a pre-step egress timestamp in flight; the first
  mean_delay of the new epoch absorbs the step size and the next Sync
  steps right back — a self-sustaining ±step limit cycle (observed at
  ±110 ms / 1 Hz) — candidate for upstream submission.
- 0005 ptp filter: linuxptp-style moving-median prefilters on both servo
  inputs — E2E path delay (CONFIG_PTP_PATH_DELAY_FILTER_LENGTH, default 9)
  and offset (CONFIG_PTP_OFFSET_FILTER_LENGTH, default 5, applied before
  the step check so a single bad timestamp can't step the clock). Filters
  reset on clock step / servo reset; length 1 disables — candidate for
  upstream submission.
- 0006 ptp servo: adaptive linear-regression servo (port of linuxptp's
  linreg.c) as Kconfig alternative to the PI controller
  (CONFIG_PTP_SERVO_LINREG; default stays CONFIG_PTP_SERVO_PI, whose
  KP/KI options now depend on it). Least-squares fit over 4–64 samples,
  window chosen by smallest long-term prediction error — no gain tuning,
  averaging adapts to measurement noise. Stepping/outlier logic stays
  outside the servo; ptp_clock_sync_interval() feeds the
  timeTransmitter's Sync interval to the phase-correction term. Fed the
  RAW offset, not the 0005 median — the median's ~2-sample group delay
  in the loop drives linreg into a full-scale ±524287 ppb limit cycle
  (seen on HW, confirmed in sim); the median still guards step/outlier
  checks — candidate for upstream submission.
- 0007 esp32s3 soc: re-init the esp_flash default chip after PSRAM init.
  PSRAM timing tuning (octal @ 80 MHz) switches the shared MSPI core
  clock 80→160 MHz after esp_flash_config() captured the old source
  frequency — every SPI1 command transaction then runs at 160 MHz, all
  esp_flash erases/writes fail the WEL check with ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND
  (261) while XIP keeps working. ESP-IDF inits the chip after PSRAM for
  this reason — candidate for upstream submission.
- 0008 ptp servo: linreg samples weighted à la linuxptp tsproc
  filter_weight (weight = filtered/raw path delay from current Sync +
  last Delay_Req) and DROPPED below weight 0.7 (max 8 in a row,
  starvation guard). Queuing delay is one-sided; without this the
  slightest cross traffic pulled the locked clock ~10 µs (weighting
  alone in sim: ~17 µs; with drop gate: ~35 ns) — candidate for
  upstream submission.
- 0009 ptp msg: drop unparseable/foreign-version messages instead of
  faulting the port. Any post_recv error raised PTP_EVT_FAULT_DETECTED,
  so PTPv1 traffic (Dante shares 224.0.1.129:319/320) kept the port
  permanently FAULTY (err-log spam per packet); also a trivial remote
  DoS. Version now checked first, -EPROTONOSUPPORT at dbg level,
  parse errors → drop (linuxptp: EV_NONE) — candidate for upstream
  submission.
- 0010 ptp servo: robust offset outlier gate + linreg phase-slew limit.
  The 0008 delay-weight gate only catches queuing spikes (raw delay
  rises); a corrupted timestamp that shifts the offset WITHOUT raising
  the delay passes it and poisons up to 64 linreg fits — observed on one
  board as periodic ~10 s bursts of ±200k ppb at 8 Hz sync while an
  identical board stayed clean. New gate rejects samples deviating
  > NSIGMA (8) × tracked-EWMA-noise (floor 5 µs) from the moving median;
  median still absorbs rejected samples (genuine level change re-opens
  the gate), escape hatch after 16 consecutive rejects. Additionally
  CONFIG_PTP_SERVO_PHASE_CORR_MAX_PPB (default 0 = off; AES67 ESP32
  conf: 2000) clamps the linreg intercept term for media-friendly
  bounded frequency excursions — candidate for upstream submission
  (gate part).
- 0011 ptp step: acquisition phase trim via atomic phase jump. Offsets
  below the 5 ms step threshold but far from zero were left to the
  servo to slew out — minutes with the 2000 ppb media clamp from 0010.
  Two observed cases: the coarse get/compute/set boot-epoch step ages by
  the SPI round-trip and lands ~800 µs off; a warm FPGA wallclock
  surviving an ESP32 reboot starts ~300–500 µs off with no step at all.
  Design: trim BUDGET (2 jumps), granted at boot and by every genuine
  step, consumed per trim, dropped once a full median lands ≤ threshold.
  Deliberately NOT re-armed by servo reset, and threshold 10 µs > one
  median-refill of free-run drift (~5 ppm × 1 s): a self-re-arming trim
  with a 1 µs threshold retriggered on its own drift — permanent ~1.7 µs
  step loop at 1 Hz, servo pinned at 0 ppb. Median-full gating keeps
  single corrupted timestamps from triggering bogus jumps — candidate
  for upstream submission.
- 0012 net_if: use a link-local IPv4 address as the last-resort source
  address regardless of CONFIG_NET_IPV4_AUTO. The firmware configures its
  own 169.254.x.y fallback (MAC-derived, added by main.c) instead of using
  Zephyr's autoconf, because NET_IPV4_AUTO force-selects NET_IPV4_ACD and
  ACD has a lock inversion: ipv4_acd_timeout() holds the ACD mutex while
  calling net_if_ipv4_acd_succeeded()/net_if_send_data() (which take
  net_if_lock), while net_if_ipv4_addr_rm() holds net_if_lock and calls
  net_ipv4_acd_cancel() (which takes the ACD mutex). Any address removal
  concurrent with an ACD timer tick — a link-down carrier teardown or a
  net_dhcpv4_stop() from another thread — deadlocks both threads with no
  panic and no log output. Without this patch the self-configured address
  would only be usable for link-local destinations; everything multicast
  (mDNS, SAP, PTP) would go out from 0.0.0.0 — candidate for upstream
  submission.

- 0013 ptp: marshal link events to the PTP thread. port_link_monitor()
  (net_mgmt thread) ran ptp_port_event_handle(FAULT_DETECTED) directly on
  link-down: port_disable() -> zsock_close() on the sockets the PTP thread
  was sleeping on in zsock_poll(-1) — freeing net_contexts still registered
  with the poller (k_poll wait-list use-after-free). On the ESP32-S3 this
  froze the whole system silently (no fault; the K_PRIO_COOP(1) PTP thread
  starves everything preemptible), triggered by pulling the cable while
  TIME_TRANSMITTER. Now the monitor records the event atomically and wakes
  the PTP thread (ptp_clock_signal_timeout); the thread handles it at the
  top of its loop, so sockets are only closed/reopened by their poller —
  candidate for upstream submission.

- 0014 ptp: re-arm the acquisition trim (0011) when a full-median offset
  parks beyond 100 us for 16 consecutive samples. Steady-state offsets of
  hundreds of us (drift across a FAULTY/link-down phase, GM wander, peer
  restart) sit below the 5 ms step threshold with no trim budget left, so
  only the 2000 ppb media-clamped slew remained: 0.5-1 ms took 4-8
  minutes (observed parked at ~500 us, ppb frequency-matched). Hysteresis
  10 us disarm / 100 us re-arm (both >> ~5 us median-refill drift) plus
  the 16-sample streak keep the 0011 self-retrigger loop impossible —
  candidate for upstream submission.

- 0015 ptp: CONFIG_PTP_APP_MANAGED_START — suppress the SYS_INIT start of
  the PTP stack and expose ptp_start() instead. The firmware ships ONE
  binary for both PTP gateware modes, reads the FPGA's system_cfg CSRs at
  boot (on external MCUs the FPGA is configured long after SYS_INIT) and
  only starts the software stack when the gateware says PTP_IN_SOFTWARE;
  otherwise no PTP thread/sockets/traffic exist and the FPGA's hardware
  PTP engine owns the wire — candidate for upstream submission.

- 0016 spi_esp32: make CONFIG_SPI_ESP32_INTERRUPT actually interrupt-paced.
  Upstream (incl. current main) forces the interrupt in transceive() and
  runs the WHOLE transfer — including the per-chunk usr_is_done busy-wait —
  inside the ISR: the thread never sleeps, the full wire time is burned
  spinning in interrupt context (~40 % of the core at 10 MHz spibone load)
  and each chunk blocks everything for its wire duration. Split
  transfer into start/finish halves; the trans_done ISR finishes one chunk
  and arms the next, the caller sleeps in spi_context_wait_for_completion
  (timeout path quiesces + releases the PM lock). Polling mode and target
  mode unchanged — candidate for upstream submission.

- 0017 i2s_esp32: target (slave) mode module clock. The driver derived
  MCLK from the frame clock (fs x 8 = 384 kHz at 48 kHz) instead of from
  BCLK (bclk x 8, the ESP-IDF rule "module clock >= 8 x BCLK"), so a
  slave receiving a 3.072 MHz BCLK sampled it with a 384 kHz clock and
  never locked. Also: rx/tx_stop_transfer() dropped the pointer to the
  block the DMA was working on without freeing it, so every DROP / STOP /
  error path leaked one slab block per direction (the slab is empty after
  a handful of restarts). Needed for the USB-audio experiment (ESP32-S3 as
  I2S slave of the FPGA media clock) — candidate for upstream submission.

- 0018 cache_esp32: treat NULL/zero-length ranges as no-ops. udc_dwc2 in
  buffer-DMA mode syncs every net_buf before a transfer, including ZLPs
  (data NULL, len 0); esp_cache_msync() rejects those with a logged
  "null pointer" error on every packet, which floods the console —
  candidate for upstream submission.

- 0019 udc_dwc2: CONFIG_UDC_DWC2_RXFIFO_MAX_PERCENTAGE. The RxFIFO share
  of the controller SPRAM was a hard-coded 25 %; on the ESP32-S3 (1 KB
  SPRAM) that is 256 B, so any OUT packet above that — every UAC2
  Full-Speed audio packet — is dropped by the core and isochronous OUT
  completes empty on every frame while IN works. Made configurable
  (default unchanged) — candidate for upstream submission. Also adds
  CONFIG_UDC_DWC2_FIFO0_PACKETS (default 2 = unchanged): the EP0 TxFIFO
  was hard-coded to two 64 B packets; with 1 the S3 budget (200 usable
  words) fits RxFIFO 110 + EP0 16 + ISO IN 74 for 2 ch 24 bit duplex.
  HW finding: the core drops an ISO OUT packet (DOEPINT.PktDrpSts) when
  the RxFIFO is smaller than about MPS/4 + 1 + one EP0 packet + 1 words,
  not just when it is smaller than the packet.
- 0020 udc_dwc2: re-arm isochronous OUT endpoints from the ISR. The
  driver used to arm the next queued OUT buffer from its thread after
  every completion; whenever a cooperative thread (Zephyr's tx_tstamp at
  K_PRIO_COOP(1), doing SPI on the ESP32) held the CPU for more than the
  rest of the frame, the host's next packet hit a disabled endpoint and
  was dropped (OUTTknEPdis + PktDrpSts, ~2 % loss). Completed ISO OUT
  buffers now go through a k_fifo (priv->iso_out_done) to the thread,
  and the ISR arms the next queued buffer immediately.
- 0021 usbd_uac2: CONFIG_USBD_AUDIO2_QUEUE_DEPTH (default 2 = the old
  fixed double-buffering). The class kept at most two transfers queued
  per AudioStreaming interface; with the ISR re-arm above the queue must
  survive several frames of class-thread latency, so the two bitmasks
  became a per-interface counter and uac2_sof tops the queue up to the
  configured depth (ESP32 build uses 4).

Merged upstream (dropped from the series):
- announce messages must advertise logAnnounceInterval (was 0004) —
  upstream f939ffaa8f "ptp: put announce interval into announce
  packages", in main since 2026-07-27.
- From the v4.2.0 era: uptime-based message aging (3ccd07b2), servo
  epoch reset after clock step, configurable PI servo gains (9803584),
  ingress-timestamp validity guards. (The phase-jump step came back as
  0003 — upstream's epoch reset only steps above 1 s.)

Rebase notes (2026-09-09, 8edca5b8df → 042104ba7e):
- 0001: `spi_config.slave` → `.peripheral` (inclusive-terminology rename).
- 0013: upstream switched the link monitor to
  NET_MGMT_REGISTER_EVENT_HANDLER, so `struct ptp_port.link_cb` is gone;
  only `link_evt` remains.
- 0016: merged with upstream 45b80b04da (wait for completion in
  interrupt mode, `asynchronous` guard) — upstream still runs the whole
  transfer in the ISR, so the split is still needed.
- Firmware side: ETHERNET_PTP hw_caps flag removed (get_ptp_clock() is
  the check now), SPI_DT_SPEC_GET lost its delay argument,
  SPI_OP_MODE_MASTER → _CONTROLLER, FIXED_PARTITION_ID → PARTITION_ID.
